# Instructions

- An user can access the app as a guest user by tapping on the `LOGIN AS GUEST` button.  
- Doing so will take the user to the main activity.  
- The `MAPS` tab will be loaded and the user's current location will be marked with a red marker. Prominent places throughout India will be marked with our custom pin, tapping on which will reveal the place and it's AQI level.  
- The next tab, `FILTER`, will let the user select a place from a list of places which is dynamically fetched from an online API. It will display an interctive graph of the recent levels of various pollutants in that particular area.
- The `INFO` tab gives a breif information about AQI standards.
- The app pushes notifications at 10 seconds, which can be changed to 3 hours as mentioned in the question. The time limit has been reduced to test the feature. Clicking on a notification will launch the application and display the map.
