## Problem Statement 4
With increasing level of air pollutions each day, people are becoming more prone to respiratory diseases. Create an application to visualize users the level of different air pollutants in their current location.  
The application should:  
1) Detect user’s location every 3 hours and send them a notification alert  
2) Clicking on the notification will launch the application  
3) The main screen of the application will consists of a Google Map and filter options that are primarily air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, Ozone)  
4) The map should display the level of the air pollutant that the user chooses in his current location

## Abstract:
## PollutAware
Remain “Pollut-ically” aware

### Problem:
With increasing level of air pollutions each day, people are becoming more prone to respiratory diseases. We are tasked with the creation of an App that helps users visualize the level of different air pollutants in their current location. 

### Solution Abstract:
We aim to create an app with the following features:  
- The App **detects the user’s location and notifies** the user about **pollution levels (AQI)** near the geographical proximity of the User.
- Users can also **view** the **level of Pollutants** (in micrograms per cubic meter) in his/her geographical proximity.
- The App provides a **map-based UI** for the user to seek Information on Air Pollution of any place **remotely** through maps.

Our App **“PolluteAware”** also has some **USPs** other than the generic solution the problem statement seeks to find.
It Includes:
1. **User History**: Details about Geographical places the User has visited along with the pollution levels the User got exposed to.
2. A **Health Hazard warning Algorithm** based on threshold values of pollutants the User got exposed to.
3. A **Speed dial/Emergency Tab** that would contain contacts of nearest Doctors and Health clinics in case of pollution-related health emergency or checkup.
4. Users will also get an additional feature to **share their geographical area’s AQI** and pollution level stats to Social media platforms (Facebook, Whatsapp, e.t.c..)

### Technology Stack:
- Android Application
  - Language: Java
    - IDE: Android Studio
- External APIs
  - [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/#/?_k=dasb9d): Open-Source AQI feed
  - [Open AQ Platform API](https://docs.openaq.org/): An API for open air quality data.
