# Problem Statement 4
With increasing level of air pollutions each day, people are becoming more prone to respiratory diseases. Create an application to visualize users the level of different air pollutants in their current location.  
The application should:  
1) Detect userâ€™s location every 3 hours and send them a notification alert  
2) Clicking on the notification will launch the application  
3) The main screen of the application will consists of a Google Map and filter options that are primarily air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, Ozone)  
4) The map should display the level of the air pollutant that the user chooses in his current location
